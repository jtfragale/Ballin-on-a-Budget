# Planning

## What I'm building:

I'm building an app that lets users track their monthly expenses. The user will be able to create an account and use a preset list of common expenses as well as add and delete items from the list. A total for all monthly expenses will be generated so the user can how much they are spending compared to how much they earn each month.

## User Stories
